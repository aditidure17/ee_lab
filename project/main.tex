\section*{Abstract}
The automatic door opening system project aims to design and implement a mechanism for opening doors without manual intervention. In this project, we propose a system that utilizes sensors to detect the presence of individuals near the door and automatically triggers the opening mechanism. The system incorporates infrared sensors to detect motion and actuates the door-opening mechanism accordingly. Additionally, we integrate a microcontroller, Arduino, to process sensor inputs and control the door-opening mechanism. The project aims to enhance convenience, accessibility, and efficiency in various environments, including commercial buildings, hospitals, and homes. Through this project, we demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of an automatic door opening system in improving accessibility and convenience while reducing the need for manual operation.

\subsection{Detailed study of each component}
\subsubsection{Arduino UNO}
The core component of the system, responsible for processing sensor inputs and controlling the door-opening mechanism. \\
The connections made from it are as shown below:
\input{tables/ARD.tex}
Pin diagram of ARD is as shown below:
\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}
\textbf{CONNECTIONS:\\}
The Arduino consists of three main sections: Power, Analog, and Digital.
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Power Section}
\begin{itemize}
\item It includes the reset pin (not utilized here), voltage pin, ground, and AREF (analog reference, not used here).
\item The 5V pin is connected to the power pins of the PIR sensor, LCD, and motor driver. The ground pin is connected to the respective grounds of these components. Other connections from this section are outlined below.
\item The backlight connections of the LCD, denoted as +L and -L, are connected to +5V and ground respectively. These connections power the backlight to illuminate the LCD panel.
\item The RW (read/write) pin of the LCD is permanently connected to ground on the Arduino, allowing write operations (sending commands).
\item Another connection involves linking the ground of the Arduino to $V_{EE}$ of the LCD to control the display contrast. A 1k resistor is included in this connection to optimize contrast.
\item Additional connections to the motor driver IC (L293D) include the enable pins, ensuring the motor driver remains enabled whenever the Arduino is powered on. This enables motor power whenever the PIR sensor outputs 1.
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Analog Section} \\
The only connection made in this section is to the PIR sensor, with its digital output connected to the A0 pin of the Arduino. This connection allows the Arduino to receive and process analog signals from the sensor.

\item \textbf{Digital Section} \\
These connections can be categorized into three groups:
\begin{itemize}
\item D13 and D12 of the Arduino are connected to RS and Enable pins of the LCD respectively. RS determines whether incoming data is interpreted as command or character data for display.
\item Connections from D11 to D8 of the Arduino are respectively linked to D4 to D7 of the LCD for later use.
\item Finally, D1/TXD (transmitting) and D0/RXD (receiving) of the Arduino are connected to IN1 and IN2 of the Motor Driver respectively. These connections control the motor direction based on the logic levels of IN1 and IN2.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{TESTING:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Begin by connecting the Arduino board to a laptop.
\item Open the Arduino IDE and test the board using the example code for blinking an LED.
\item Verify that the LED blinks as expected, indicating proper functionality of the Arduino board.
\end{enumerate}

    \item \textbf{Library Inclusion}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The code includes the necessary libraries, such as LiquidCrystal.h, to interface with the LCD display.
        \end{itemize}
        
    \item \textbf{Pin Definition}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Pin assignments for the LCD, PIR sensor, and gate motor are defined using preprocessor directives.
        \end{itemize}
        
    \item \textbf{Setup Function}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The setup function initializes the LCD and configures pins for input and output.
            \item Initial messages are displayed on the LCD to indicate system readiness.
        \end{itemize}
        
    \item \textbf{Loop Function}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The loop function continuously monitors the PIR sensor for motion detection.
            \item Upon detecting motion, the system activates the gate motor to open the gate and displays relevant messages on the LCD.
            \item After a delay, the gate motor is stopped temporarily before closing the gate.
            \item The system repeats this process as long as motion is detected.
        \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}








\subsection{Sequential Mechanism}

The automatic door opening system operates through the following sequence:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Initialization}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The system powers on, initializing all components.
            \item The LCD display shows an initial message indicating system readiness, such as "Automatic Door Opener."
        \end{itemize}
        
    \item \textbf{Monitoring for Motion}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The PIR sensor continuously monitors its surroundings for motion.
        \end{itemize}
        
    \item \textbf{Detection of Motion}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Upon detecting motion, the PIR sensor sends a signal to the Arduino Uno.
        \end{itemize}
        
    \item \textbf{Decision Making}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The Arduino Uno processes the signal from the PIR sensor to determine if someone is approaching the door.
            \item If motion is detected, the Arduino Uno decides to initiate the door-opening sequence.
        \end{itemize}
        
    \item \textbf{Initiating Door Opening}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The Arduino Uno sends signals to the motor driver to activate the door-opening motor.
        \end{itemize}
        
    \item \textbf{Door Opening}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The motor rotates, smoothly opening the door.
            \item The LCD display shows a message indicating that the door is opening.
        \end{itemize}
        
    \item \textbf{Monitoring Door Position}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The system continuously monitors the position of the door to ensure it reaches the fully open position.
        \end{itemize}
        
    \item \textbf{Door Fully Opened}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Once the door reaches the fully open position, the motor stops, and the Arduino Uno receives confirmation.
        \end{itemize}
        
    \item \textbf{Waiting for Motion to Cease}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item If no motion is detected for a predefined period, the system waits for motion to cease.
        \end{itemize}
        
    \item \textbf{Detection of No Motion}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item If no motion is detected for the predefined period, the PIR sensor sends a signal to the Arduino Uno indicating the absence of motion.
        \end{itemize}
        
    \item \textbf{Closing the Door}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Upon receiving the signal indicating the absence of motion, the Arduino Uno initiates the door-closing sequence.
            \item It sends signals to the motor driver to activate the motor in the reverse direction, causing the door to close.
        \end{itemize}
        
    \item \textbf{Door Closing}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The motor rotates in the reverse direction, closing the door.
            \item The LCD display shows a message indicating that the door is closing.
        \end{itemize}
        
    \item \textbf{Monitoring Door Position}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The system continuously monitors the position of the door to ensure it reaches the fully closed position.
        \end{itemize}
        
    \item \textbf{Door Fully Closed}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Once the door reaches the fully closed position, the motor stops, and the Arduino Uno receives confirmation.
        \end{itemize}
        
    \item \textbf{Idle State}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The system returns to an idle state, ready to detect motion and initiate the door-opening sequence again when necessary.
        \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{NOTE:} We haven't connected a door in here. So the clockwise and anticlockwise rotation of door shows the opening and closing of door.
